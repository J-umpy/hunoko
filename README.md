# Hunoko
Tired of ugly ROM site UIs? Hunoko is a download manager with custom theme support designed to make the ROM downloading experience more pleasant.

Note: While Hunoko is designed for downloading ROMs, it is assumed that this tool will not be used for piracy. This is for downloading backups of your own ROMs or homebrew apps for emulators only. ROM sites which only host illegal copies of games will not be officially supported, and I encourage you not to develop your own custom plugins to circumvent this policy. For sites that host homebrew alongisde illicit content, please only download the content which you may legally access within your jurisdiction.

Hunoko is still in active development. Commits will not be posted until test code is removed and downloads will not be provided until around halfway through pre-alpha.
